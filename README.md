# Bookstore Management API

I designed this mock API and supporting documentation site for [Specialization in API Documentation](https://www.pce.uw.edu/specializations/api-documentation), which is offered by the University of Washington. 

In the scenario I came up with, developers use this API to build custom bookstore applications.

The Bookstore Management API is only designed to run with [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).


My API docs are [located here](https://btbristow.github.io/bookstore-management-api/).
