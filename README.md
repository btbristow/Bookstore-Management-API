# Book Tracker API
This API is designed for booksellers to track their store inventory, customers, and orders. It has three endpoints:

* `/books` - Books in the store inventory.
* `/customers` - Customers, who purchase books using orders.
* `/orders` - Orders from customers, made up of books.

[Documentation](https://btbristow.github.io/book-tracker-api/) is in progress. To learn more, contact your sales representative.
