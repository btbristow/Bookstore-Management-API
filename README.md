# Bookstore Management API

An imaginary REST API designed for [Specialization in API Documentation](https://www.pce.uw.edu/specializations/api-documentation), offered by the University of Washington.

This API works only with [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server), but the [accompanying documentation site](https://btbristow.github.io/bookstore-management-api/) is real.
