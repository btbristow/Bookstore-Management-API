# Bookstore Management API

I designed this mock REST API and documentation site for [Specialization in API Documentation](https://www.pce.uw.edu/specializations/api-documentation), offered by the University of Washington. This API is only designed to run with [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

In the scenario I created, developers use the Bookstore Management API to build custom bookstore applications.

The documentation site is [located here](https://btbristow.github.io/bookstore-management-api/).
